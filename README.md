# New Features

## Shortcuts

Workflows can now be run using keyboard shortcuts. Click the Shortcut Button (next to the Play Button) to add a keyboard shortcut (e.g. F12 or ctrl+shift+a) to your workflow.

## Wait for me

Wait has a new mode, "wait for me", that lets you control when/whether a workflow should continue. Use it to incorporate manual/non-automatable tasks in the middle of a workflow.

## If copied text

If has a new mode, "if copied text", that lets you add conditions based on the most recently copied text (using ctrl+c). Use it to incorporate external data in your workflow's decision-making (similar to "if my response", which adds conditions based on user-inputted data).

## Run workflow

Run has a new mode, "run workflow", that lets you re-use steps from other workflows. Prompts and starting windows are carried over accordingly.
