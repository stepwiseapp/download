## 🆕 What's New

### 💻 Use Stepwise on up to 3 Devices
You can now install and use Stepwise across **three separate devices** under a single account.  
This is a better compromise for individual users who want flexibility to automate across a laptop, desktop, or work machine — without needing a team or enterprise license.  
🛠 _Coming soon_: cross-device syncing of workflows and preferences.

### ⏳ 30-Day Trial System
New users receive a **30-day trial** of Stepwise Premium with access to:

- Unlimited workflows
- The workflow recorder
- Advanced shortcuts
- No credit card required

Our trial detection logic also ensures fair usage across devices.

### 🔴 Automatic Workflow Recorder
Create workflows by example — just hit record and perform your tasks. Stepwise will generate the workflow in real-time.  
Perfect for users who want automation without the drag-and-drop editor.

### 🧠 Smart Features in Development
This update lays groundwork for upcoming AI-powered tools:

- Natural language → automation translation
- Automation suggestions based on repeated activity

📣 _Stay tuned — these are coming soon to premium users._

- Global shortcut toggle
- Implicit wait timing between steps
- Hotkey/hotstring detection during recording
- Raw AutoHotkey code widget toggle
- Delete all workflows (wipe)
- _Coming soon_: Gaming Mode, Sound FX on widget drop

### ▶️ Animated Workflow/Recorder Icon
A sleek animated icon now appears when workflows are running or being recorded.  
Easily track background automations at a glance.

### ⛔ Abort Workflows Instantly (Shift + Esc)
Press `Shift + Esc` to immediately stop:

- Any running workflow
- Active workflow recording

Useful in emergencies or testing scenarios.

### 🖱️ Multidrag Widgets (Shift + Click)
You can now select and move **multiple widgets** at once in the editor using `Shift + Click`.  
Massively improves productivity and layout control.

### 🤖 Raw AutoHotkey Code Support (Advanced Users)
